The MBA admissions process can be expensive. Between GMAT study books, tutors, and application fees the dollar value really starts to add up. If you’re interested in admissions consulting but are hesitant because of the price tag, we’ve put together our best tips for working with admissions consultants on a budget.  

1) **Group Discounts**

If you’re applying to MBA programs and have friends/peers doing the same, think about trying to sell your business as a bulk purchase to get a discount. You can do this on your own or AdmissionsMarket has a pre-established set of consultants willing to offer special discounts for “group bookings”, as well as a consistent stream of clients you can pair together with.

2) **Go International**

In special circumstances, international consultants can offer you great expertise at a very reasonable price. These consultants might charge 20-30% of the going-rate in the U.S. but have extremely specialized areas of expertise (e.g., work exclusively with candidates from specific countries or industries). There are also a lot of lemons so be sure to use the recommendation of a friend (or AdmissionsMarket) to find someone reputable.

3) **Don’t go “All In” with multiple schools**

Purchasing a one school package and then adding additional hourly services to get limited support on additional applications can save you money and is usually enough support. Just make sure you know exactly what support you need to make the most of your “à la carte” hours and set clear expectations with your consultant up front.

4) **Name Your Price Options**

Special pricing options may exist if you are applying more than six months before your application deadline and are flexible on the consultant with whom you want to work. Under these circumstances, AdmissionsMarket can work with you to name your price and minimum standards. If you commit, we will work with our network of consultants to see who is willing to take on a client at the given rate.

5) **Think Non-Profit**

If you’re African American, Hispanic or Native American, consider applying to Management Leadership for Tomorrow in order to get discounted admissions consulting support. They offer top-notch services at highly discounted rates for high-achieving men and women from  underrepresented communities. To learn more visit [here](https://ml4t.org/mba-prep/).

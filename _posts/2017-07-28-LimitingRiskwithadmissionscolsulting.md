We started AdmissionsMarket to bring transparency to the admissions consulting industry. We were tired of friends getting sold on a guaranteed admission to HBS, only to be left $10,000 poorer and no acceptances to their name. To protect your financial investment, do your due diligence and keep the following principles in mind to ensure you’re walking away with the best possible support.

1. **Ask the Right Questions**
Ask good questions from the on-set in your 30 minute initial conversation. Take this opportunity to learn about their credentials, get a feel for “fit”, and set expectations on communication and other key issues. If helpful, check out our blog on 8 questions to ask your admissions consultant.

2. **Review Credentials and Choose Wisely**
As general practice, steer away from young/unproven part-time consultants. Look at their LinkedIn, do they have a full-time job? Did they recently lose their job and seem to be doing this on the side? These consultants may try to entice you with low rates, but remember your end goal and don’t be swayed by an extra 10% savings. The person you choose must have a proven track record of commitment. If not, they likely won’t have any official training and could easily drop you when life gets busy or they find that next full-time job.

3. **Steer Clear of “Guarantees"**
Stay away from consultants who make questionable guarantees. The truth is no one can guarantee your spot at your top school. What consultants can do for you is guide you in the admissions process so that you have the best tools at your disposable to get into your dream MBA program. If they seem to promise something either in writing or over the phone that seems dubious, recognize it as the sales trap that it is and walk away.
